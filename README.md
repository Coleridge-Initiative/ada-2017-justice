# Applied Data Analytics training program - Justice 2017
The [Coleridge Initiative](coleridgeinitiative.org)'s Applied Data Analytics training program focused on criminal justice.

### Overview
The training program is designed to address public sector challenges, but is applicable to a broad range of fields such as sociology, public health, computer science, survey statistics, and federal departments. Completion of this program will equip participants with the tools necessary to effectively manage and undergo technology and analytics projects, as well as open the door to the fields of statistical analysis, software development, and data science. This program is designed for professionals with a mastersâ€™ degree or above with some emphasis in a quantitative field (e.g. statistics, economics or computer science) or at least two years working in a hands-on, data-oriented field.

## Data Available for Class

For both class notebooks and team projects, participants of the Applied Data Analytics Training Program have access to several datasets, including confidential micro-data hosted on the secure Administrative Data Research Facility platform. The datasets available include:

- Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) data
- Illinois Department of Employment Services (IDES) data
- Census LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES)
- HUD program data
